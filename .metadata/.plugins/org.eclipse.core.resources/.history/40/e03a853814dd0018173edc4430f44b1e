		/*
		 * Session 
		 * A session is intended to identify a user who is sending request.
		 * Sessions collect key value paris which can then be accessed between requests
		 * This allows us to store info about a user throughout the lifetime of 
		 * session.
		 * How it works:
		 * Java produced a cookie called the JSESSIONID that contains a unique token
		 * This token is then provided on future request, which identifies which value
		 * map should be provided for the session.
		 * Limitations:
		 * 1. Session information is stored in memory, this means when the app shuts down
		 * , the session and all session data are lost.
		 * 2. Also due to information being stored in memory, this makes app stateful.
		 * The application must store data for individual users in memory. As a consequence,
		 * the memory requirements of the app will grow with the number of users.
		 * This results in an app that will not scale well
